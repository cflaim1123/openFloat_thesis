## Project description
Ocean salinity, a measure of salt concentration in seawater, is a key variable influencing water density and controls important processes like mixing and stratification. Temporal and spatial salinity variability is high in dynamic coastal systems like Puget Sound, which can present a challenge for making salinity measurements that can characterize this variability. Salinity is typically measured using conductivity cells, a sensor that quantifies electrical current through seawater. These sensors can be deployed on ship-based CTDs, spatially-limited moorings, or costly AUVs and can have limited long-term stability. This project, therefore, proposes the development of a cost-efficient DIY profiling float for salinity estimation by way of back-calculation from the TEOS-10 equation of state of seawater. This calculation will be made from known float properties – float density at neutral buoyancy which equals surrounding seawater density – and the in-situ measurement of pressure and temperature via float sensors. This project aims to develop and validate a cost-effective profiling float from common materials with the potential application to increase data resolution in spatially and temporally dynamic estuary systems. For the proof of concept, the float will be deployed alongside a Seaglider in Colvos Passage, WA, for data validation. Unlike many areas of dynamic coastal ecosystems, Colvos Passage experiences high levels of mixing due to local bathymetry and poses as a unique validation site for float development since there is limited spatial variability, making cross-comparison of with the Seaglider easier. This ensures that salinity calculations from the float can be compared to Seaglider data in the same parcel of water to determine the float’s salinity estimation accuracy compared to an industry-standard method for measuring salinity.  

The openFloat will collect pressure and temperature, GPS location, lux, temperature, internal humidity, internal temperature, and internal pressure data. All data will be written to an onboard SD card and transmitted to an onshore radio controller via 915 mHz LoRa (long-range) radio. A digital Onshape CAD model of the openFloat can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a3a60be64346f3ab3cbba062/w/3aa2cdeafc929d436fb9bbdd/e/518a3778be8193c016e5ac27?renderMode=0&uiState=65cc61833a62837281ccbb15).

## openFloat Materials
The openFloat is built from 3D-printed and stock hardware and electronics; all parts can be 3D-printed or easily purchased from websites such as [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), or [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/?utm_adgroup=DigiKey&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=EN_Brand_Digi-Key&utm_term=digikey&utm_content=DigiKey&utm_id=go_cmp-120498675_adg-40368337894_ad-596393199263_kwd-136797198_dev-c_ext-_prd-_sig-Cj0KCQiAw6yuBhDrARIsACf94RWBRqzEcXLML9vEeFG1U0Cs7uAZAXh7rRQ0GD5xSQHI2-V4hFxq0_waAl9AEALw_wcB&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAw6yuBhDrARIsACf94RWBRqzEcXLML9vEeFG1U0Cs7uAZAXh7rRQ0GD5xSQHI2-V4hFxq0_waAl9AEALw_wcB).

## openFloat Project Concept
The openFloat aims to increase data resolution in dynamic systems by cost-effectively measuring traditional oceanographic data such as temperature, pressure, and salinity. Salinity is not traditionally cheap to measure (e.g., a decent conductivity cell costs ~$5,000).
