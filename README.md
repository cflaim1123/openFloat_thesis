## Project description
This project aims to quantify haloclines in Colvos Passage Puget Sound, WA, by building a DIY profiling float that costs ~500 USD to manufacture. Traditional autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cost ~100,000 USD or more. We hope to obtain high-quality data using traditional AUV deployment and propulsion methods with a DIY AUV. This reduces the financial barrier required to use AUV data collection methods for scientific research and allows higher resolution data to be obtained since more instruments can be purchased with the same lump sum of money. 

The openFloat will collect 12-bit analog pressure and temperature, GPS location, lux, temperature, internal humidity, internal temperature, and internal pressure data. All data will be written to an onboard SD card and transmitted to an onshore base station via 915 mHz LoRa (long-range) radio.
